Convert signed integer to string and back using x86 Assembly

This is a small project that I completed in x86 Assembly Language *(MASM)*. This program reads in ten signed integers as strings from the user. It then validates and converts those strings to actual signed integers. A sum of the numbers is then calculated along with the rounded integer average. The numbers are all converted to strings and then displayed to the user.

- This project uses the Irvine32 Library
- All parameters are passed on the stack
- Implements and uses macros to read and display strings
- All type conversions are done manually
